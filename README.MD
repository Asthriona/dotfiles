# My personal dotfiles. 
 
Nothing fancy here, if you want some crazy ground breaking stuff, wrong place to look.  
I'm using my debian only for work, and I wont "rice" it. I'm fine with all the default stuff, and mostly just edit things for convinience.
Like adding screenshot to I3 config, or move my workspaces around.  
My nvim config can be found at [asthriona/nvim](https://github.com/Asthriona/nvim)  
I will keep updating this as I work, maybe I'll do some funny stuff in the future, but I'm deffo not interested in that right now.

There is nothing fancy here, if you want some crazy groundbreaking stuff, it's the wrong place to look.  
I'm using my Debian only for work, and I won't "rice" it. I'm fine with all the default stuff and mostly edit things for convenience.  
Like adding screenshots to the I3 config, or moving my workspaces around.  
My nvim config can be found at [asthriona/nvim](https://github.com/Asthriona/nvim)  
I will keep updating this as I work, maybe I'll do some funny stuff in the future, but I'm deffo not interested in that right now.
